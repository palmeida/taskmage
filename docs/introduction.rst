.. Taskmage introduction

Introduction
============

Taskmage is a task manager. It allows you to add tasks, log spent time and mark
them completed.

At the moment, it consists of a text mode interface writing to a .csv file, but
it is a goal of the project to develop a program that is flexible enough so 
that different interfaces (web application, desktop GUI, smart phone apps...) 
and backends (JSON, database, caldav...) can be plugged in.

Read the :doc:`manual` to learn how taskmage works.
